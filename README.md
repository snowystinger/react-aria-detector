react-aria-detector
===========

Chrome extension that detects [React Aria](http://react-spectrum.adobe.com/) in apps as you browse.

Adds a badge to the extension icon when you come across a page that is built using React Aria.

This is a fork from [react-detector](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-detector) with some changes.

Future improvements:
 - Update a local database with base urls that use React Aria.
 - Update a remote database.
 - Add a popup with a list of urls that use React Aria.
